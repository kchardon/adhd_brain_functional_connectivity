# ADHD Brain Functional Connectivity with Omega

## Introduction

During my internship, I worked on brain age prediction \[[1](#brain-age1), [2](#brain-age2)\] with the Omega dataset \[[3](#omega-paper), [4](#omega-data)\]. Unfortunately, we didn't obtain good scores for this task with Omega (see my internship report for details [here]()). We wanted to understand why age prediction didn't work: did we apply wrong preprocessing or was the dataset just not adapted for this task?

We thus decided to reproduce some results from other papers using Omega with our preprocessing. To do this, we chose \[[5](#adhd-connectivity)\] in which the authors use MEG resting-state recordings from Omega to detect ADHD based on Brain Functional Connectivity.
